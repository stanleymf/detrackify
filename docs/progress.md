# Progress - Order Management Application

## Project Overview
Building a Shopify to Detrack logistics platform bridge application with spreadsheet-style dashboard for order management.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Build ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Full UI-only prototype with localStorage persistence

**Completed Features**:
- ✅ Dashboard with spreadsheet interface
- ✅ All 33 required dashboard fields implemented
- ✅ Editable cells with inline editing
- ✅ Order selection and bulk export functionality
- ✅ Settings page for Shopify store management
- ✅ Field mapping configuration with concatenation support
- ✅ Mock data system with realistic sample orders
- ✅ Professional Olive/Dust color scheme
- ✅ Status management (Ready for Export, Exported, Error)
- ✅ localStorage persistence for all data

**Technical Implementation**:
- React + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular component architecture
- Mock API simulation for export functionality

## Current Status: READY FOR USE
The application is fully functional as a UI prototype. All requirements from the PRD have been implemented and the application provides a complete user experience for:

1. **Order Management**: View, edit, and manage orders in spreadsheet format
2. **Shopify Integration Setup**: Configure multiple store connections
3. **Field Mapping**: Map Shopify fields to dashboard columns with concatenation
4. **Export Workflow**: Select and export orders to Detrack (simulated)

## Known Limitations
- Backend API calls are mocked (as intended for prototype)
- No real Shopify webhook integration (localStorage simulation)
- No actual Detrack API integration (mock responses)

## Future Enhancements (Post-Prototype)
- Real Shopify webhook endpoint implementation
- Actual Detrack API integration
- User authentication system
- Advanced filtering and search
- Bulk editing capabilities
- Export history and logging
