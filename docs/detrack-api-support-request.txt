4. Error Response
-----------------
HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
Response Body: <h1>Internal Server Error</h1>

5. Troubleshooting Steps Taken
-----------------------------
- Confirmed API key is valid (GET requests to the same endpoint work and return job data).
- Confirmed endpoint and payload format match Detrack v2 API documentation.
- Tried with both new and previously deleted order numbers.
- Tried with minimal and full payloads.
- Always receive a 500 error on POST, even for new jobs.

6. Questions for Detrack
------------------------
1. Does my API key have write permissions for job creation?
2. Is there any additional account setup required to enable POST/job creation?
3. Are there any required fields missing or any constraints on the payload?
4. Is there a way to get more detailed error information for debugging?

Thank you for your assistance!
